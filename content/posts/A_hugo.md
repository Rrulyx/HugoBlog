# Quick Start
For the blog, I followed the [Quick start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) tutorial of HUGO. 

I changed the theme for the theme for the [Hermit-V2](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hermit-v2/). Therefore, I had to make a little setup in the `hugo.toml` configuration file.

## Deployment

I deployed the site to GitHub by following the [Host on GitHub Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) tutorial. 

This is my first website !
