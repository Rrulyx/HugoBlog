# Quick Start
For the blog, I followed the "[Quick start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)" tutorial of HUGO. 

I changed the theme for the theme for the "[Hermit-V2](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hermit-v2/)". Therefore, I had to make a little setup in the `hugo.toml` configuration file.
