# Setup of Unity

I already had Unity installed from another course. Because I did not want to use too much space, I decided to stay on the same version and just add the necessary modules for this course:

Once the modules installed, I created a new 3D project. The first thing i did was changing the background color while on play mode because I made too much unsaved changes on my previous project (every modifiations made while in project mode are discarded). This is done via the `Preferences > Colors > Playmode tint`:

You can immediately say when you are in play mode:
