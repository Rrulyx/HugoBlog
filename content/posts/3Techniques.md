# Scalable Market

### Core idea
You move and scale a supermarket around you.

This is inspired by the [hologram map](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMDneicBizU) in avatar, except you can scale it as big as you want and make it go all arround you.


### Manipulation

You move in the scene by pinching with your hands as you would do on a tactile screen with your fingers. Then you move the supermarket arround you up to the point where the desired object is right in front of you, and here you just grab it

#### Goals 
- Being more efficient
- Having a better spatial understanding
#### Evaluation
- Time
- Supermarket memory
#### Drawbacks
- Only single player


# Doctor Octopus

### Core idea
You have expandable arms to grab AND move

This is inspired by [Otto Octavius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8GYAO8bRFU&t=113s) in spiderman.


### Manipulation

You have a second pair of arms which is an extension of your actual arms, but scaled up. Because they are bigger, you can push toward the ground and it will make you go up in the air. This way, you can move in the supermarket to get close to the product with one arm, and select it with the other one.

#### Goals 
- Move less
- Movement in funnier
#### Evaluation
- Time
- Mastery of the environment (presence + memory of the Supermarket)
#### Drawbacks
- Hard to master
- Can lead to motion sickness


# Magic powers

### Core idea
You launch objects in the air then slice through mid air to select them, making a mess in the process

This is inspired by the video games [Control](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMkJf9N4bz4&t=52s) and [Fruit Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COFeh96bfWI). Control for how you launch objects in the air and Fruit Ninja for how you select them once in the air.

### Manipulation

You make a upward movement with your arms to lift object off the ground, then tyhy will magically float in the air, where you can select them by slicing through them with your hand or with a katana that you will have in your hand (to be able to reach further)

#### Goals 
- Feel powerful
- Have fun
#### Evaluation
- Accuracy (Objects close together will be blown apart and easier to select in the air)
#### Drawbacks
- Lots of actions and coordination needed to pickup one item
