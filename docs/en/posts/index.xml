<p>Once the modules installed, I created a new 3D project. The first thing i did was changing the background color while on play mode because I made too much unsaved changes on my previous project (every modifiations made while in project mode are discarded). This is done via the <code>Preferences &gt; Colors &gt; Playmode tint</code>:</p>

			<description>Quick Start For the blog, I followed the Quick start tutorial of HUGO.
I changed the theme for the theme for the Hermit-V2. Therefore, I had to make a little setup in the hugo.toml configuration file.
Deployment I deployed the site to GitHub by following the Host on GitHub Pages tutorial.
This is my first website !</description>
