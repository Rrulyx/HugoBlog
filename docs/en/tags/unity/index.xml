      <description>Setup I followed the Unity tutorial named Roll a Ball. It was a simple Unity project to understand the basics of making a game.&#xA;Most of the setup is basic, most of the work is already done for you, you just need to open a template. The only issue is that I was not able to create a URP (Univesal Render Pipeline) project because my version of Unity is too old, so I created a more basic 3D poject.</description>

      <description>Setup of Unity I already had Unity installed from another course. Because I did not want to use too much space, I decided to stay on the same version and just add the necessary modules for this course:&#xA;Once the modules installed, I created a new 3D project. The first thing i did was changing the background color while on play mode because I made too much unsaved changes on my previous project (every modifiations made while in project mode are discarded).</description>
